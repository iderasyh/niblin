# Model Placement and Serialization Rules

- All data models must be placed within the `domain` folder of their corresponding feature directory.
- The structure should follow: `lib/src/features/[feature_name]/domain/[model_name].dart`.
- Models **must not** use the `freezed` or `json_serializable` packages. Implement serialization and immutability manually or using other appropriate methods if required.

This rule ensures consistency in project structure and avoids specific dependencies for model generation, aligning with the guidelines in [project-architecture-structure.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-architecture-structure.mdc).
