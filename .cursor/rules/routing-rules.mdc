# Routing rules

- Always use [app_router.dart](mdc:lib/src/routing/app_router.dart) for routing definitions.
- Navigation is handled by the `go_router` package.
- Route names and paths are defined in the `AppRoute` enum within [app_router.dart](mdc:lib/src/routing/app_router.dart).
- Always navigate using `context.goNamed(AppRoute.routeName.name)` where `routeName` is a member of the `AppRoute` enum.
