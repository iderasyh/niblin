# UI Rules

## Responsiveness
The project must be responsive and adapt to all screen sizes. To achieve this, use the utility class defined in [responsive_utils.dart](mdc:lib/src/core/utils/responsive_utils.dart). This class provides convenient access to responsive spacing, font sizes, and other metrics.

## Colors
All colors used in the application are defined in [app_colors.dart](mdc:lib/src/core/constants/app_colors.dart). Always use colors from this file to maintain a consistent color scheme.

## Theme
The application has a custom theme defined in [app_theme.dart](mdc:lib/src/theme/app_theme.dart). This theme configures the overall look and feel of UI components, including typography, button styles, and color schemes. Adhere to this theme when building UI components.

When creating or modifying UI, you **must** adhere to the utilities and definitions in these files to ensure a consistent and responsive design.
